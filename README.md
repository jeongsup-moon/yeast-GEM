## Description

This repository contains the current consensus genome-scale metabolic model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. It is the continuation of the legacy project [yeastnet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/). For the latest release please [click here](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases).

## Citation

* If you use yeast-GEM please cite the yeast8 paper:
  > Lu, H. et al. _A consensus S. cerevisiae metabolic model Yeast8 and its ecosystem for comprehensively probing cellular metabolism._ Nature Communications 10, 3586 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11581-3.
* Additionally, all yeast-GEM releases are archived in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/52777598), for you to cite the specific version of yeast-GEM that you used in your study, to ensure reproducibility. You should always cite the original publication + the specific version, for instance:
  > _The yeast consensus genome-scale model [Lu et al. 2019], version 8.3.4 [Sánchez et al. 2019], was used._

## Installation

### Required software - User:

* Matlab user:
  * A functional Matlab installation (MATLAB 7.3 or higher).
  * The [COBRA toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox).
* Python user: Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7

### Required software - Contributor:

* Both of the previous Matlab requirements.
* The [RAVEN toolbox for MATLAB](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN).
* A [git wrapper](https://github.com/manur/MATLAB-git) added to the search path.

### Dependencies - Recommended software:
* For Matlab, the [libSBML MATLAB API](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/MATLAB%20Interface/) (version 5.17.0 is recommended).
* [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com/registration/download-reg) for any simulations.

### Installation instructions
* For users: Clone it from [`master`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) in the Github repo, or just download [the latest release](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases). If you work in python, please create an environment with all requirements:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt  # installs all dependencies
  touch .env                                    # creates a .env file for locating the root
  ```
* For contributors: Fork it to your Github account, and create a new branch from [`devel`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/tree/devel).

## Usage

Make sure to load/save the model with the corresponding wrapper functions!
* In Matlab:
  ```matlab
  cd ./code
  model = loadYeastModel(); % loading
  saveYeastModel(model);    % saving
  ```
* In Python:
  ```python
  import code.io as io
  model = io.read_yeast_model() # loading
  io.write_yeast_model(model)   # saving
  ```

### Online visualization/simulation

* You can visualize selected pathways of yeast-GEM and perform online constraint-based simulations using [Caffeine](https://caffeine.dd-decaf.eu/interactive-map), by creating a simulation with the latest yeast-GEM version available, and choosing any _S. cerevisiae_ map (currently only `iMM904` maps are available). Learn more [about Caffeine](https://caffeine.dd-decaf.eu).
* Additionally, you can interactively navigate model components and visualize 3D representations of all compartments and subsystems of yeast-GEM at [Metabolic Atlas](https://metabolicatlas.org/explore?selected=Yeast-GEM). Learn more [about Metabolic Atlas](https://www.metabolicatlas.org/about).
